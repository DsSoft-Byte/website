            Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
            in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
            folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
            to open your own folder.
            You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
            sample project.

        <h3>Extreme Overclocking if customer wants to</h3>
        <p>
          We enable XMP on compatible systems and RAM modules but this is not the limit, i hod the 3rd place worldwide for the i7 9700 and RTX2060 combo, and i overclock, to the silicon limits.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Optimised for the average user, Pro and Enthusiast</h3>
        <p>
          The "averge user" packet will come with microsoft windows 10/11 and if wished on B365 systems, with Windows 7. The "Pro" Packet will cost less because of the windows license and will be delivered without an Operating system or "evaluation version" of Microsoft Windows. Linux is free and Open-Source and recommended for Enthusiasts but also availbale here. The Enthusiast packet will include benchmarking software overclocking utlities and diagnostics tools.
